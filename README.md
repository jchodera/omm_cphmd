What is it?
===========

This is a program designed to carry out constant pH MD simulations according to
the models implemented in Amber for both implicit and explicit solvent.

The goal is to support both implicit and explicit solvent CpHMD running natively
on GPUs, both reading and writing native Amber input files for running these
kinds of calculations.

pH-REMD support through MPI is also planned.
